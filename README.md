# ðŸš€ My Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Python practice repository!** ðŸŽ‰ This is where I document my learning journey as I explore the fundamentals of Python programming. Every time I learn a new concept, I write a simple Python program and add it here. This helps me reinforce my understanding and track my progress.

## ðŸŒ± What You'll Find Here

You'll find basic Python programs covering:  
- âœ… Functions (`def`, `return`)  
- âœ… If-Else conditions  
- âœ… Loops (`while`, `for`)  
- âœ… Python basics (`print`, `input`, variables)  
- âœ… The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle  
- âœ… Problem-solving with Python3  

In addition to these basics, I have written some **intermediate-level Python programs** and now I'm expanding my collection by adding **DSA-related programs**, starting with algorithms.

Each program is a small step in my coding journey, improving my logic and coding style. If you're also learning Python, feel free to check out the code, suggest improvements, or even share your own insights!


## ðŸ“Œ Why This Repository?
- **Practice makes perfect.** Writing code consistently helps solidify concepts.
- **Sharing my progress.** This is my learning space, and I want to reflect on how far I've come.
- **Connecting with fellow learners.** If you're also learning Python, let's connect and grow together!

## ðŸ”¥ What's Next?
I'll keep adding more Python programs as I progress. Stay tuned for more beginner-friendly programs, and letâ€™s master Python one step at a time. ðŸš€
