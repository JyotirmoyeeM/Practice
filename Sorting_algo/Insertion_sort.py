"""
Insertion Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm.

It divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted part. 
Initially, the first element is considered sorted. 
Then, one by one, it picks elements from the unsorted part and places them at the correct position in the sorted part.

ğŸ‘‰ For ascending order:
We keep moving left while the current value (key) is smaller than the value on its left.
We stop when we find a value smaller than or equal to the key.

ğŸ‘‰ For descending order:
We reverse the comparison.

This continues until all elements are placed in the correct position.
