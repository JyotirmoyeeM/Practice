  Problem statement
Your task is to write a function named print_composite that prints if there are any composite numbers up to a given number, n.



Composite numbers are positive integers greater than 1 that have more than two positive divisors. In other words, a composite number has factors other than 1 and itself.

Explanation :
A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two positive divisors. In other words, it is not a prime number. Here are the composite numbers between 2 and 10:
4, 6, 8, 9, and 10
